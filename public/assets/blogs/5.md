The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world in ways more than one. Life - at home, outside - has changed considerably. The workplace, too, has been transformed as new rules of (dis)engagement have taken shape. Technology has become an intrinsic part of work-life, and will only continue to exercise more influence.  

So what does a post-Covid workplace look like? What are the key traits that will be essential for survival for those joining the workforce this year? Can technology compensate for human interaction and company and water-cooler jokes?  

We spoke to a few lady bosses, and here’s what they have to say about the changed scenario.  

**‘Adaptability, Agility Will Be Crucial’**  
As an architect who has set up many offices for MNCs, Shaon Sikta Sengupta says that corporations understand the need for “creating great physical infrastructure and attractive office environments.”  

Sengupta, who is the Director and Head of North India Region - Edifice Consultants, feels that Covid has, however, “over the past year, changed the direction of these employee requirements towards creating corporate structures that are sensitive to the mental well-being of their employees.”

“Adaptability, Agility, Innovation, and Teamwork are crucial to the survival of businesses and can be achieved only with an emotionally healthy team,” she says.  

And her one piece of advice for those joining the workforce this year?  

“Keep all your options open. Be ready to debunk what you have known to be a given till now,” she says.  

**‘Things Don’t Matter, People Do’**  
Yukti Arora acknowledges that the pandemic has changed her world view.  

“While it has “had a catastrophic effect on humankind, we have been buoyed by the power of our resilience and the love and support of friends and family,” the Chief Product Officer & Co-founder of Buildsys, says.

A reality check in ways more than one, she adds that it made her realise that change, after all, is inevitable, and adaptability is the only way forward.  

“The pandemic taught me that things don’t matter; people do. I learnt the hard way that you could plan your entire life down to the T, but it's impossible to anticipate a global pandemic,” Arora notes.  

And her advice to women professionals joining the workforce in 2021?  

“Ignore the naysayers, boldly tread into uncharted territory. Aspire to be women in the C-suite, think big and innovate,” she says.  

**Of Team Spirit & Surviving**  
Angelique Dhama, the Chief Marketing Officer of Mirzapur-headquartered carpets and rugs brand OBEETEE, feels that the pandemic has been a reality check when it comes to how corporations functioned.

“Covid has taught us that we are never out of office and we must always be available. Every new day is an opportunity to reflect on our endeavors for improvising the processes we had earlier,” Dhama says.  

Introspecting on the year gone by, she adds that technology has changed the way work is done, cutting down on “travel for meetings”, thanks to “having found a way around it through digital platforms.”  

“Communication within teams improved as we created close circuit groups. The year also saw the teams coming together, that is one of the most important aspects – A strong team that fights and survives together,” she adds.  

Her advice to the Class of 2021: Be consistent, always remember that you are only as good as your last performance.  

**Tech That**  
During the pandemic, Sapana Jain finally got around to being able to organise all her notes, loose bits of material and sketches in one place. And she counts that as an impactful lockdown learning.

Jain, Principal Designer, I Heart Homez, feels that in a post-Covid set-up, it is essential to align one’s skills with technology as much as possible.  

“The pandemic has forced us to adopt new approaches that combine virtual and in-person collaboration allowing designers to use this moment to reimagine the future of spaces and places without any hindrance,” the Mumbai-based designer says.  

And her message to women artists and designers waiting to debut in 2021?  

“I believe in the interest of equality; as a designer myself I look forward to seeing our upcoming designers voice their opinions through art and design elements in their own authentic way,” she says.  

**No Keeping Up With The Joneses, Please!**  
For Rakhee Bedi, the most important takeaway from the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown(s) was that it is possible to work from home. Bedi, Founding Principal, RSDA, also realised that the “social pressure of keeping up with everyone you know eventually wears off.”

“One starts choosing who they want to spend their quality time with, and becomes more selective regarding who and what they give their time to,” the Delhi-based architect-designer says.  

And her message to women is a strong one - don’t get pulled down at all.  

“Women shouldn't get bogged down by societal pressures around them and shouldn't feel the need to show anyone that they're better than someone else. They should just work hard for their dreams,” she reiterates.  

**Life In The Fast Lane**  
Ritika Ahuja, COO, Big Boy Toyz, maintains that post-Covid one certainly needs to be “faster and smarter!”

“I live by it and believe it’s one of the most essential traits for survival in a corporate set-up. You need to be creative and think out of the box to stand out of the crowd and be ahead of others,” the Delhi-based Ahuja says.  

And there is no waiting time to shine, she says. Her word of advice to women pros this year includes staying focused and having goals.  

“If the time and circumstances are right, do not wait for tomorrow just walk out and start working towards it,” she adds.  

**Upwards & Onwards … In 2021**  
After the year that 2020 was, Mitu Mathur remains highly positive about 2021, thanks to “adaptability and innovation” which she feels have brought about a lot of change in the way companies have started functioning post-Covid.

“With rapid changes in the environment all around us, it is vital to imbibe sustainable and biologically-balanced architecture. Looking at the demand and supply gap, especially in the residential sector, the challenge is to produce mass affordable housing that uses efficient technologies such as prefabrication and modular design,” the director of GPM Architects and Planners says.  

She also goes on to add that there cannot be a better time to join the workforce.  

“The flexibility at the workplace and work culture has really proved wonders for a lot of women at our firm, and others I meet on a regular basis. Being digitally available while managing your personal chores has never been so readily acceptable,” she says.  

Her advice to women joining the workforce is to “never stop trusting your inner instincts”.  

“Give due time to your family and yourself; if you are good at your work, nobody can take your talent away from you,” she says.
