Mobile apps replacing conventional 2D drawings and methods in the new era of rapid construction

The construction industry has played a pivotal role in responding to the crisis caused by the global pandemic, from constructing hospitals in record time to refurbishing spaces as per social-distancing norms. The shift towards digitization and the efficient use of smartphones has led to enhanced mobility and improved efficiency in all workflows.

The performance of the construction industry has been suboptimal when compared with other sectors. Stagnant productivity, low levels of digitization, and inefficient paper-driven processes have hampered productivity in the past. The case for adopting digital tools to aid construction management has only become stronger, post the shift towards remote work in light of the Coronavirus pandemic. These digital tools have proven to improve productivity, digital workflow management, real-time progress tracking, and advanced schedule optimization.

Unlike most workplaces, construction sites are dangerous and often have poor network connectivity; therefore, using a desktop or a laptop is not always feasible. Most people in the construction industry are first-time technology users making ease of operation a critical aspect. Considering that mobile applications fit the criteria of mobility and ease of implementation, it should come as no surprise that they can potentially replace conventional 2D drafting tools and outdated systems involving manual entry.

Mobile devices have made viewing drawings and making minor edits a much more convenient and standardized process. They help with the efficiency of on-site execution, eliminate mistakes, and help project managers coordinate with their workforce. Construction applications like Buildsys automate operations such as sending reminders and follow-up emails and double up as a consolidated database for your project that you can access on the go. Most significantly, construction applications allow for mobility and remote access and provide offline access to real-time and context-specific information.

Technology is all-pervasive; it infiltrates every aspect of our lives â€“ from our smartphones to IOT home appliances. Resistance to the growing trend of digitization is the antithesis of innovation. Mobile applications help eliminate the redundancies caused by outdated paper-driven systems and will be instrumental in revolutionizing productivity in the construction industry.
