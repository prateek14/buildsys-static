Mobile Applications enabling management of the construction lifecycle through cloud & collaboration technology

The construction industry consistently seeks out new methods of digitizing multiple amounts of data, including drawings, texts, images, coordination and communication. One such way to enable this would be by using cloud and collaboration technologies.

Cloud collaboration is a way of working in which many people can access, evaluate, and edit a document in real-time. With cloud sharing, the days of merging several documents and dealing with out-of-date copies are over. Cloud-based construction management offers a slew of advantages to the construction industry, enabling projects that use it, to operate efficiently; it is more than just a storage facility or device and refers to the technique and procedures used to control a construction project.

The benefits of using cloud technology for a project manager or any individual in the construction industry would be improved organization, higher participation levels, improved access to large files, updates that happen over real-time, more accessible methods of team collaboration.

According to a study conducted by the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), 85% of building contractors use or plan to use cloud-based solutions. One of the most valuable aspects of devices powered by the cloud is that of switching devices and still having access to the same information. Cloud technology has the added advantage of ensuring security as opposed to paper.

Cloud technology is highly effective for companies, especially when it comes to collaboration. The facility to collaborate effectively and connect through cloud computing will improve the quality of work performed, while also shortening the time required to complete projects.

As a construction project manager or anyone for that matter needs to update or make a change. Cloud computing is a worthwhile investment for construction firms of all sizes due to its increased performance, productivity, usability, and securityâ€“as well as its sheer convenience.
