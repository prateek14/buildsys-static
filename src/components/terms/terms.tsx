            <p>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we may either
                delete or deidentify it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has
                been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it
                from any further processing until deletion is possible.

            <h4>Privacy Notice Changes</h4>
            <p>

                give you or our Client notice by posting the revised Privacy Notice on the Sites prior to the change
                becoming effective.
